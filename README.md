# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge-Danny-Ma-Case-Study
This repository comprises my solutions to the case studies found in the [8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). The 8 Week SQL Challenge presents 8 distinct SQL challenges. In addition to solving these case studies using SQL, I have also provided Python solutions.


In each case study folder, you will find one .md for creating the database(and data cleaning) and two .md solution files, one written in SQL and another in Python.
